# From R Markdown to PDF Slides, Fussily

This package provides an [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) format and a template for creating presentation slides from R Markdown source, converting to PDF using [Beamer](http://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) to create slides, speaker notes (or a talk script), and audience handouts from a single source file. The color scheme is light-on-dark, using a system font (and not the trademark ugly sans-serif Beamer default) in both slide text and in figures generated by R. A supplied [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org) theme makes plots from ggplot as well as from base graphics likewise light-on-dark. Otherwise, it is very similar to the [default pandoc Beamer formats](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html).

To install, use

```R
devtools::install_github("agoldst/scuro")
```

This package uses the pandoc templates and supporting files used in my [Easy Lecture Slides Made Difficult](http://github.com/agoldst/elsmd), which supports generating slides, notes, and handouts from ordinary markdown. See that page for more detail on how to use ordinary markdown for this. (`elsmd` does not need to be separately installed; it is included in `scuro`.) This package then adds on support for generating some material (plots, tables...) using R code.

# Using the package

To use the package, start from the supplied `lectures` template. Choose RStudio's "New File > R Markdown..." command, and select "Dark-on-Light Beamer Slides." Or, in R, do

```R
rmarkdown::draft(file="course", template="lectures",
    package="scuro", edit=F)
```

which creates a new directory called `course` under the working directory. `course` contains two folders, `notes` and `scripts`, and a `Makefile`. R markdown files go in either of the two subfolders: if they are in `notes`, they are taken to be talks to be given from notes, and if they are in `scripts`, they are taken to be written-out lectures. Running `make` generates three PDF files for each R markdown, which appear in three newly created directories: `slides` for slides, `handouts` for slide handouts, and `lectures` for speaker notes or scripts.

Two example files are provided, [notes/notes-sample.Rmd](inst/rmarkdown/templates/lectures/skeleton/notes/notes-sample.Rmd) and [scripts/script-sample.Rmd](inst/rmarkdown/templates/lectures/skeleton/scripts/script-sample.Rmd), which show how to compose talks in the two styles.

For displaying the slides, I recommend [Présentation](http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/), a free program with an excellent presentation mode for PDFs.

The `course` directory also contains a `course.Rmd` file, which is just a stub required by the `rmarkdown` template structure. You can delete it.

# The format

The R package provides a single `rmarkdown` format, `scuro::scuro_md`. Using `rmarkdown::render` to this format (or RStudio's "Knit" button) generates a markdown file suitable for subsequent conversion into beamer slides, handouts, `beamerarticle` scripts, and 4-up speaker notes. The output is somewhat configurable; in particular, the YAML metadata can adjust fonts (the `sansfont` is used for the slides), code-highlighting schemes, and default figure dimensions. See the example `Rmd` files as well as the R help file for `scuro_md`.

One weakness of the dark-on-light scheme is that it doesn't look great on paper (and wastes ink); I am working on a solution.

You do not need to load the `scuro` library in your Rmd file.

## Overlay specifications (incremental builds)

Beamer supports what it calls "overlay specifications," that is, ways of generating multiple copies of a slide with varying pieces of the content visible. But the `<1,3>` notation beamer uses doesn't always work well with pandoc's markdown processing. This package kludgily fixes this issue with a [pandoc filter](inst/elsmd/overlay_filter). Instead of beamer's `<...>`, however, you should use `{<...>}`, as in

```latex
\note{<1,3>}{I am a note for stages 1 and 3.}
```

## Grid positioning

The minimalism of markdown and the text-oriented nature of LaTeX combine to make any tweaking of the layout of slides quite tricky. This is supposed to be a feature: this whole generating-from-plain-text thing is supposed to enable you to avoid laying things out! Nonetheless, sometimes a slide really does need a more complex layout than the basically left-to-right, top-to-bottom text-like sequencing of markdown. This package lets you use the [textpos](http://ctan.org/pkg/textpos) LaTeX package's grid-positioning features in your markdown. It sets up a 9 x 8 grid (and LaTeX length units `\TPHorizModule` and `\TPVertModule`), and you can use the LaTeX `textblock` environment in your markdown as normal:

```latex
\begin{textblock}{2}(4,3)
A two-unit-wide block with upper left corner at grid position 4, 3
\end{textblock}
```

knitr's chunk options for figures are also modified to interact with this. If a chunk has a `textblock_width` option, its output will be placed in a `textblock` environment of the specified width in grid units at a position given by the `textblock_pos` option (a two-element vector of grid coordinates); the `out.width` and `out.height` options are reinterpreted as grid units. If you wish to use the grid units but not the `textblock` environment, instead use the `inside_textblock=T` chunk option. For more details, see the package help in R on `plot_hook_textpos`.

## Other tweaks

A few further knitr [chunk options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/) have different defaults from the built-in formats: `tidy` is off, and, in figures, 
`size` is `footnotesize`  and `dev.args` is `list(pointsize=9)` (this small test will scale up fine when you project the beamer PDF). The package also sets up a custom option, `dark_theme`, which applies the `dark_plot_theme` contained in the package (see its help topic in R) to all ggplots. This is on by default, but if you wish to fall back to the ggplot default, set `dark_theme=F` (and/or simply add your own `theme()` to plots). To remove the dark-on-light theming of the slides themselves, put `scuro: false` in your YAML metadata.

The package defaults to TikZ graphics and the xelatex engine. This is slower than pdf graphics and pdflatex but visually worth it. If you are using TikZ but want to alter the tikzDevice options, note that the package installs a [chunk hook](http://yihui.name/knitr/hooks/) to the `tikz_xelatex` option and sets all chunks to default to `tikz_xelatex=T`. Turn this off to change things (or look at [the code](R/knitting.R) for `tikz_setup_hook`).

Otherwise, the [underlying pandoc template](inst/elsmd/elsmd-slides.latex) is close to the default beamer template, with a few tweaks and a few choices I've made for you. Some of the annoying beamer gewgaws are suppressed as well.

# "Scuro"?

Because the slides are mostly dark, and little about knitr-xelatex-tikz wrangling is *chiaro*.
