```{r setup, include=F, cache=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

The `chiaro_pdf` format is meant for articles to be printed (or viewed as PDFs) in the ordinary black-text-on-white-paper style. The main thing it adds to an ordinary R Markdown-to-PDF setup is Ti*k*Z figure wrangling: by default the document's main font will be used in figures as well (change this with a `plot_font` option under `output`). It also sets a black-and-white ggplot theme as the default (disable this with chunk option `theme_bw`). The default figure dimensions are 4 in by 2 in (adjustable via chunk options or as options to the output format called `fig_width` and `fig_height`). Figure settings almost always require some tweaking, with special attention to the interaction between the `fig.width` and `fig.height` parameters and the `out.width` parameter: the former two set the size of the image file (and hence its aspect ratio) whereas the latter gives the width (as a TeX dimension) in the final document. If you do not change `out.width`, it will be set to the actual width of the image file or the `\textwidth`, whichever is smaller. The type size *before* any scaling will be `\footnotesize` (set via chunk option `size`). Figure placement, captioning, and labeling are by the usual `knitr` and LaTeX mechanisms. See fig.\ \ref{fig:cars}.

# A very good typographical idea


The LaTeX is based on a custom template which uses the `memoir` package, the template included in my [memarticle](http://github.com/agoldst/memarticle) setup. A copy of this is included in this package. The page format is one-sided (symmetric margins) by default, but can be overridden by specifying `classoption: [twoside]`. The accompanying Makefile here lets you simply use `make` to turn this file into a PDF.

You can use `biblatex` or `biblatex-chicago` for references. In order to get `rmarkdown` to process this correctly, set `citation_package: biblatex` as a *format* option (under `scuro::chiaro_pdf`). For `biblatex-chicago`, set  metadata key `biblatex-chicago: true`. Set the remaining pandoc bibliography keys as normal, including `biblatexoptions` and `bibliography`. Set `citation_package: none` to disable this feature.\autocite[An example citation:][]{wilde:soul}

```{r cars, fig.cap="Something about cars"}
ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_point(aes(wt, mpg, color=factor(gear))) +
    labs(color="Gear")
```

Code listings and output may be included too, with the usual chunk options, but note that the `echo` chunk option is set to false by default.

```{r code, echo=T}
exp(1i * pi) + 1
```

(It's okay, R, math is complex.)
