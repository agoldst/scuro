# for written-out talks...

Sometimes you want to speak from a written-out script rather than notes. This file demonstrates this approach. Note the use of horizontal rules or second-level headers to start slides and first-level headers to end them. Text between the end of one slide and the start of the next will appear only in the script. (This paragraph follows the title slide. A first-level header is needed to demarcate the start of the script.)

-----

> - text slide with an incremental
> - build

# First-level headers close slides

And those headers appear only in the script. The incremental build is collapsed in the script as well.

## an example table

```{r}
kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5],
      caption="Something about cars")
```

# \ 

If you'd rather have a blank than a bold header in the script, use `# \ ` (*a backslash followed by a space*) to terminate the slide. (An empty header is eliminated by knitting.) A new slide also terminates the previous slide, as in the following examples.

## an example graphic

```{r graph, fig.cap="I think that I shall never see"}
ggplot(trees, aes(Girth, Height)) +
    geom_point(color="white")
```

## ugly examples of custom placement and sizing

```{r displaced, textblock_width=2.75, textblock_pos=c(0, 1), fig.height=3, fig.width=2, out.height=4, center=T}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl))) +
    geom_bar(color="white", fill="grey40") +
    xlab("Another car thing")
p
```

\begin{textblock}{2.75}(3,2)

Look! a dodgy three-column layout!

With great layout power comes great, etc., etc.
\end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{2.75}(6,1)
```{r displaced-over, inside_textblock=T, center=T, out.width=2.75}
p
```

Text scaling: \\
a cautionary tale.
\end{textblock}

\vspace{8\TPVertModule}

# \ 

On the script, the `textpos` grid is shrunk down. Note too that `textblock`s take up no vertical space, so to prevent overprinting in the script you must manually insert some vertical space with `\vspace`. Extra vertical space at the bottom of a slide will have no effect on the slide output (just the script).

## example code display

```{r code, echo=T}
cor(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1)
cor(anscombe$x2, anscombe$y2)
```

Definitely don't need to visualize.

# final remark

Nonetheless, don't think plotting the data is synonymous with analyzing it. Let's discuss....
