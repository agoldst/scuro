  fig_width = 4.5,
  fig_height = 2.75,
  fig_crop = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{fig_width, fig_height}{default figure dimensions (inches). Note that
beamer slides have small "physical" dimensions: 128 mm x 96 mm or about 5
in x 3.75 in. The default values here are meant for slides with just one
figure on them (and possibly a title and a caption).}

\item{fig_crop, latex_engine}{same as for the built-in
\code{\link[rmarkdown]{beamer_presentation}}, but XeLaTeX is the default
engine}

\item{highlight}{syntax highlighting scheme to be used on slides. Note that
this option is currently only supported if specified in the R markdown
source.}

\item{highlight_paper}{syntax highlighting scheme to be used on handouts and
notes. Note that this option is currently only supported if specified in the
R markdown source.}

\item{dev}{graphics device. \code{"tikz"} for TikZ graphics is the default,
since one of the main points of this package is to transcend bad beamer
fonts. This requires installing the \pkg{tikzDevice} package.}

\item{plot_font}{if TikZ and XeLaTeX are used, the name of the main font for
graphics. If \code{"sansfont"} (the default) or \code{"mainfont"}, the value
of the corresponding document metadata field is used. If unspecified, the
sans font is used if that has been specified. Otherwise we fall back to the
LaTeX default.}

\item{plot_font_options}{given a \code{plot_font}, font options. if
\code{plot_font} is \code{"sansfont"} or \code{"mainfont"}, the
corresponding font options will be used by default.}

\item{scuro}{whether to apply the scuro color scheme to slides themselves.}
}
\value{
an R Markdown output format used by
  \code{\link[rmarkdown]{render}}.

\description{
The strategy adopted by this package is to knit R markdown to markdown
and then control the subsequent PDF generation using a Makefile to
govern pandoc and latex. That lets us generate multiple PDFs from a single
R markdown source without re-knitting.
